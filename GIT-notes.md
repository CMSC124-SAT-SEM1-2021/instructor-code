# GIT
## What is it?
Git is version control system (VCS) or a source control management (SCM). It basically tracks the changes you make in your files. Usually used in programming projects to check changes made in code bases. Allows you to have multiple versions of your codebase, ease of merging new code in working codebase, ease of updating other versions to reflect any changes in the main codebase. Makes collaboration easier.

## If git is an SCM, what is github?
Online platform that uses git to keep track of changes in the codebases kept there via repositories. Github is an cloud platform that uses git.

## Git Stuff
### Repository
- This is a special folder where you store your code. Stuff in this folder gets the changes made to them tracked. You can bookmark those tracked changes by making `commits`. 
- Usually you work with two repos: online one (up in github) and a local one (in your machine).
